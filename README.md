# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this Analysis is to make it easy for customers to select their next vacation package by easily selecting location based on certain factors such as weather. 

We begin by creating a code to retrieve weather data for a set of locations pinpointed by their latitude and longitude. 

Then a destination map is created listing nearby hotels to the city closest to the cities listed. 

Finally, a travel itnerary map is created showing the route to take to each city on the roadtrip using gmaps.
